## üíª Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your computer:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anaghanoop/Hospital-Database-management-system-.git
cd Hospital-Database-management-system-
```

### 2. Install Python

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.

- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Verify the installation:

```bash
python --version
```

### 3. Install MySQL Server

- [Download MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

Follow the installation wizard and set a root password.

### 4. Install Required Python Packages

You need the `mysql-connector-python` package to connect Python with MySQL.

pip install mysql-connector-python
```


### 5. Set Up the Database

1. Open MySQL Workbench or use the MySQL CLI.
2. Create the database and tables as required (refer to any provided SQL scripts like `db_setup.sql`).
3. Update the database credentials in your Python files (usually in a config section or at the top of the main script):

```python
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="your_mysql_user",
  password="your_mysql_password",
  database="hospital_db"
)
```

### 6. Run the Project

Find the main Python file (such as `main.py` or `app.py`). Execute it:

```bash
python main.py
```
